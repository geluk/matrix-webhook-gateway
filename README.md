# Setup

Run `start-matrix.sh` in `./synapse-dev` to set up a local appservice 
development environment with Docker. This will start up a Synapse and an Element
instance, which you can use for testing the appservice.

```bash
cd synapse-dev
./start-matrix.sh
```

Go to http://localhost:8009 and log in using the following credentials:

Username: `dev`

Password: `appservice-dev`
